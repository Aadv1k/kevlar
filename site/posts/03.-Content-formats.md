# Content formats

Kevlar supports markdown in-house, but you can specify your own [via the configuration](02.-Configuration.html)

Files prepended with `.filename.md` will be parsed but will remain unlisted.

## Asset management

If kevlar finds a `./assets/` folder in your project directory, it will simply copy the contents of it to `./dist` (after all the files are processed). So any images links in your markdown post, must point to the current folder.

## markdown

```markdown
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

- List item #1
- List itme #2

1. Ordered list #1
2. Ordered list #2

--- 
***

Content with *italic*, _another italic_, **bold**, ***bold italic** and ~~striked~~ support.
Each new line will be added to the previous as a singular paragraph

[Links are supported as well](https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar)
