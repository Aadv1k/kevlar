# About

I was looking for a SSG which was

- Minimal, requiring no setup or additonal packages to be installed
- out-of-the-box, loaders for `markdown` and `rst` which are the primary content formats I use should be included out of the box.
- Fast

Hence came kevlar; Writen under 1.5K lines of (hopefully safe) C code, compiled as a single binary executable.
