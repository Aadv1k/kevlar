# Theming

Theming in kevlar, just like other features, is minimal but extensible. 

For a theme to be a "valid" one, it has to have these following archetypes. Without these kevlar won't recognize it as a theme at all.

### post.html 

This is called after a post has been parsed to html. Within this, if you specify a `--CONTENT--` tag, it will be replaced by the parsed html contents of a post.

### index.html 

Will be called once kevlar has successfully parsed all files within `./posts/`

### (header|footer).html

when kevlar sees a `--HEADER--` or `--FOOTER--` anywhere within the theme, it will replace those with the **parsed** contents of the respective file.

### globals

- `--AUTHOR--`: replaces the line with `author` field from your config.
- `--TITLE--`: replaces the line with `title` field from your config.
- `--LISTING--`: an array of list items with links pointing to each post.
- `--STYLE ./styles/index.css--`: Replaces with the line with contents of `.css` file sorrounded with style tags
- `--SCRIPT ./script/script.js--`: Replaces with the line with contents of `.js` file sorrounded with script tags
