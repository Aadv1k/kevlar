# Introduction

Kevlar is a

- Minimal, single binary requiring no setup or additonal packages to be installed
- out-of-the-box, with a fast markdown parser

SSG or Static site generator written under 1.5K lines of (hopefully safe) C code.

## Installation

You can get the [kevlar executable](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar/releases/latest) from the github releases page. Kevlar supports both `win32` and `unix-like` operating systems.

## Creating your first project

Once you have the kevlar executable you can simply run

```
./kevlar new my-project
```

This will setup up a new kevlar project for you with the following structure

```
.
├── config.ini
├── posts
│   └── hello-world.rst
└── templates
    └── kyudo

3 directories, 2 files
```

run `../kevlar build` to build the site to `./dist` and serve `./dist/index.html` to see the site in action.
