# Configuration

Configuration for kevlar is pretty minimal, but provides you with sufficient flexibility to be able to do what you want.

## Required fields

```
author=The 4th duke of winecounty
title=Awesome site

theme=kyudo
# this will simply try and look for a folder in `./templates`
```

## Optional fields

Additonally, if you don't want to use the default markdown parser, you can specify your own. this will use the string provided in the command field and attempt to run it as a system command in the following format `STRING ./posts/INPUT.md ./dist/OUTPUT.html`

```
md_loader=
```
