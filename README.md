# Kevlar ðŸª¢

An _utterly_ simple and fast Static Site Generator built using C

_NOTE_: This project is being continuously worked on, and is being built in fragments, so currently the full functionality might be missing.

**elevator pitch**

> maybe you take notes, or write articles in X format, you would like to quickly convert your project into a website without any extra baggage and minimal shift to your existing workflow, introducing kevlar, an utterly simple SSG.

## Features

- **Cross platform:** Runs both on windows and unix-like operating systems!, tested with -
  - windows 11 v21H2
  - Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) on Windows 10 x86_64 ([WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/))
- **Recipes included:** with support for a custom spec of reStructuredText out of the box, (more to come)
- **Highly extensible:** Support for basic yet scalable templating
- **Simple:** Kevlar does not try to do too little or too much, just enough to get the job done.

## Quickstart

To get start with kevlar, you need `GCC` and `make` which are the primary build tools used by kevlar

### Unix-like

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar
cd kevlar && make all
./bin/kevlar help
```

### win32

You may need something like [mingw32-make](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Extension/make/mingw32-make-3.80-3/), and gcc for windows for this to work

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar
cd kevlar && make kevlar_win32
"bin/kevlar.exe" help
```

You can, then using the kevlar CLI create a new project (for unix-like)

```shell
./bin/kevlar new ../my-cool-project
cd ../my-cool-project && ./kevlar/bin/kevlar build
```

## Configuration

Each kelvar project must have a `config.ini` file; kevlar uses a custom `.ini` parser which was hacked together under 30 minutes, so some advance `.ini` functionality might be missing. Here is a configuration with all the options

```ini
author=John Doe
title=The title of my site
rst_loader=rst2html5
# ^- You can specify your own program for parsing rst, when left empty, default will be used
theme=kyudo
# ^- looks for themes inside ./templates dir
```

## Recipes

These are the loader kevlar comes with out-of-the-box.

### rst to html

Kevlar can parse `.rst`, however it is not to the exact specification; Here are all of the features of reStructuredText which are supported as of now Can be built as its own individual program using `make rst2html`

```rst
=================
The main h1 title
=================

A h2 title
==========

A h3 title
----------

Every other text is a paragraph; which supports *italic*, **bold** and ***bold italic*** text.

1. This is an ordered list
#. This syntax is also supported
4. Your lists don't need to be in order for them to be parsed properly

- **Unordered** list item 1
- Unordered *list item* 2

Inline-code blocks are supported: `printf("%s\n", "hello world")`

Links are also supported; here is a `Link to this repository https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar`_
```

### md to html

Convert a custom spec of markdown to html; can be built as a separate program by `make md2html`

```md

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5

This is a paragraph 
Which also includes this sentence, so multiline 
paragraphs are supported

Unless you leave a line, in which case this is a separate para


1. This is an ordered list
3. Your lists don't need to be in order for them to be parsed properly

- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
* Another way 
* Anohter item 
```

### Templating

kevlar has it's own custom templating language which is supported out of the box

#### Header tag

This tag looks for a `header.html` in your specified theme, it then parses the header with this templating and replaces the `--HEADER--` with it.

```html
--HEADER--
```

#### Footer tag

This tag looks for a `footer.html` in your specified theme, it then parses the header with this templating and replaces the `--FOOTER--` with it.

```html
--FOOTER--
```

#### Style tag

The `--STYLE--` will look for the specified css file and insert it's content as style tags within the html

```html
--STYLE ./style.css--
```

#### Listing tag

You can add `--LISTING--` anywhere to get a list of all the files that were passed from `posts` to html.

```html
<ul>
  --LISTING--
</ul>
```

#### Content tag

As each file is parsed into html, on success it is read internally stored inside a struct, putting `--CONTENT--` will simply load the contents of the string.
This only works when called from `post.html` within your theme, since `post.html` is parsed everytime a new file is parsed from the posts folder.

```html
--CONTENT--
```

#### Additional tags

Given you have a valid `config.ini` file inside your project, kevlar also proivdes you with the `--AUTHOR--` and `--TITLE--` tag which correspond to whatver option you provided to the `author` and `title` field.

### Theming

Kevlar supports theming with very specific archetypes, each theme must contain a

- `index.html`: the end `index.html` in the `./dist` will be generated using this template.
- `post.html`: content from each individual post (as html after conversion) will be parsed through the template
- `header.html` (if called): The header file called by `--HEADER--`
- `footer.html`(if called: The footer file called by `--FOOTER--`

psst - you can check out the theme [kyudo](https://github.com/aadv1k/kyudo) to see the flexibility you get with this templating system
