## Recipes

Kevlar has it's own markdown loader if you would like to build it as it's own executable you can run `make md2html`
You can build the loader kevlar uses to parse `.md` files as their own executables by running.

You will get the respective CLI

## CLI

```shell
$ kevlar
kevlar <cmd> <opt>
  help       -- print this help message
  new        -- create a new site skeleton
  new-post   -- create a new post with defaults
  build      -- build if in a kevlar project
```

### `kevlar new <NAME>`

Sets up a basic skeleton for a site and a basic `config.ini`

```ini
theme=listing-kevlar-theme
```

- `theme=`: looks for the given theme within the `./templates/` dir.

### `kevlar new-post <TITLE>`

Generates a `.md` file in the current folder with the following archetype

```
Title=This is a title
Date=2023-01-24 17:44:10
Order=1
```

- Title: the name of the link that will show up with `--TITLE--`
- Date: current date, put AS-IS with `--DATE--`
- Order: the order in which the post will show up in `--LISTING--`

## Config

the only required config is the `theme` option in the `config.ini` files.
