# Kevlar ðŸª¢

An _utterly_ simple and fast Static Site Generator built using C

_NOTE_: This project is being continuously worked on, and is being built in fragments, so currently the full functionality might be missing.

**elevator pitch**

> maybe you take notes, or write articles in X format, you would like to quickly convert your project into a website without any extra baggage and minimal shift to your existing workflow, introducing kevlar, an utterly simple SSG.

## Features

- **Recipes included:** with support for a custom spec of reStructuredText out of the box, (more to come)
- **Highly extensible:** Support for basic yet scalable templating
- **Simple:** Kevlar does not try to do too little or too less, just enough to get the job done.

## Recipes

In the `./recipes/` folder you may find certain scripts these are adapted from their corresponding `./src/` files and can be compiled to individual programs. 

```shell
make rst2html
```

### Quickstart

To get start with kevlar, you need `GCC` and `make` which are the primary build tools used by kevlar.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar
make all
./bin/kevlar
```

You can, then using the kevlar CLI create a new project

```shell
./bin/kevlar new ../my-cool-project
cd ../my-cool-project && ./kevlar/bin/kevlar build
```

### Templating

Templating is supported out of the box, kevlar its own custom templating language

#### Header tag

This tag looks for a `header.html` in your specified theme, it then parses the header with this templating and replaces the `--HEADER--` with it.

```html
--HEADER--
```

#### Footer tag

This tag looks for a `footer.html` in your specified theme, it then parses the header with this templating and replaces the `--FOOTER--` with it.

```html
--FOOTER--
```

#### Style tag

The `--STYLE--` will look for the specified css file and insert it's content as style tags within the html

```html
--STYLE ./style.css--
```

#### Listing tag

You can add `--LISTING--` anywhere to get a list of all the files that were passed from `posts` to html.

```html
<ul>
  --LISTING--
</ul>
```

#### Content tag

As each file is parsed into html, on success it is read internally stored inside a struct, putting `--CONTENT--` will simply load the contents of the string.

This only works when called from `post.html` within your theme, since `post.html` is parsed everytime a new file is parsed from the posts folder.

```html
--CONTENT--
```

#### Additional tags

Given you have a valid `config.ini` file inside your project, kevlar also proivdes you with the `--AUTHOR--` and `--TITLE--` tag which correspond to whatver option you provided to the `author` and `title` field.

### Configuration

Each kelvar project must have a `config.ini` file; kevlar uses a custom `.ini` parser which was hacked together under 10 minutes, so some advance `.ini` functionality might be missing. Here is a configuration with all the options

```ini
author=John Doe
title=The title of my site
rst_loader=rst2html
# ^- You can specify your own program for parsing rst 
theme=kyudo
# ^- looks for themes inside ./templates dir
```
### Theming

Kevlar supports theming with very specific archetypes, each theme must contain a
- index.html: the end `index.html` in the `./dist` will be generated using this template. 
- post.html: content from each individual post (as html after conversion) will be parsed through the template 
- header.html: The header file called by `--HEADER--`
- footer.html: The header file called by `--FOOTER--`
